RADAR DATA PROCESSING NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes how the radar products distributed with this project
were generated, and what would be required for an independent user to
reproduce those results.

The processing described here uses the Open Polar Radar (OPR) toolbox, a set
of MATLAB routines originally developed to support CReSIS radar
sounder processing, but now designed to support other radar systems.

Because of the total volume of raw radar data (~3 PB), source data are not hosted on a public
facing server. Instead, the raw inputs and supporting files are maintained on
CReSIS servers. These can be accessed by any interested party by requesting an
account and using the CReSIS/OPR computing environment. The processing scripts
provided here depend on that environment and will not run correctly without
OPR’s expected directory structure, shared support files, and global toolbox
configuration.

SUMMARY OF PROCESSING WORKFLOW

The delivered products were generated using a standard OPR processing sequence:

SAR processing

Generates SAR-focused radar products required for
subsequent image formation steps.

Array processing (final image formation)

Combines multi-channel SAR outputs into final imagery products.

Can generate either:
a) 2-D SLC-style products via the “standard_phase” workflow, or
b) 3-D tomographic products via the “music” workflow

Collate

Merges products produced under multiple transmit configurations into a
unified image volume.

SCRIPTS USED

The processing pipeline is orchestrated by a top-level MATLAB driver script:

Run_MultipleSteps_Greenland.m

This script calls the following step-specific scripts:

Run09_sar_rds_ndh.m
- Runs the SAR processing stage.
- Produces the precursor SAR products required for later array processing.

Run10_array_rds_ndh.m
- Runs array processing using SAR outputs from Run09.
- Produces either 2-D or 3-D products depending on configuration.

Run11_collate_Greenland.m
- Collates outputs from multiple transmit configurations into a unified
final image volume.
- Can optionally perform layer tracking.

Together, these scripts implement the pipeline from SAR precursor generation
to the final derived products that are distributed.

PARAMETER SPREADSHEETS

OPR processing is controlled using parameter spreadsheets. These spreadsheets
encode:

Which segments and frames to process

Where raw radar data are stored

Radar waveform definitions (sampling rates, time gates, chirp settings)

SAR processing parameters

Array processing parameters (2-D vs 3-D workflows)

Output, posting, and data product settings

Two example parameter spreadsheets are provided:

rds_param_2011_Greenland_P3.xlsx
rds_param_2012_Greenland_P3.xlsx

PRACTICAL REQUIREMENTS TO REPRODUCE RESULTS

To reproduce the results distributed with this dataset, a user will need:

Access to the CReSIS/OPR environment, and the CReSIS data servers. Raw 
radar data are prohibitively large to distribute via a web interface.

Supporting metadata and intermediate products are stored on CReSIS
servers and must be accessed there.

OPR toolbox installed and configured.  A startup script must create 
and populate the global “gRadar” variable and set the MATLAB path to 
include OPR toolbox commands.

gRadar must correctly point to raw data, support directories, and output
product locations.

This is a practical, minimal set of steps for reproducing the products:

Step 1: Request access
- Email opr@openpolarradar.org
 to request an account on the CReSIS servers.

Step 2: Configure OPR
- Install OPR and configure startup.m so gRadar points to:
* raw radar data directories
* metadata directories (GPS/INS)
* support directories (records, frames)
* output directories (CSARP products)

Step 3: Install parameter spreadsheets
- Place the provided parameter spreadsheets in the OPR parameter repository
and confirm that read_param_xls can load them correctly.

Step 4: Run the pipeline
- Run Run_MultipleSteps_Greenland.m, which will:
a) generate SAR precursor products (Run09)
b) generate array products (Run10; either 2-D or 3-D)
c) collate transmit configurations and optionally track layers (Run11)
