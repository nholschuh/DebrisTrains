RADAR DATA PROCESSING AND REPRODUCIBILITY (OPR TOOLBOX)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes how the radar products distributed with this project
were generated, and what would be required for an independent user to
reproduce those results.

The processing described here uses the Open Polar Radar (OPR) toolbox, a set
of MATLAB routines originally developed to support CReSIS radar
sounder processing, but now designed to support other radar systems.

Because of the total volume of raw radar data (~3 PB), source data are not hosted on a public
facing server. Instead, the raw inputs and supporting files are maintained on
CReSIS servers. These can be accessed by any interested party by requesting an
account and using the CReSIS/OPR computing environment. The processing scripts
provided here depend on that environment and will not run correctly without
OPR’s expected directory structure, shared support files, and global toolbox
configuration.

SUMMARY OF PROCESSING WORKFLOW

The delivered products were generated using a standard OPR processing sequence:

SAR processing (precursor generation)

Generates SAR-focused (or semi-focused) radar products required for
subsequent image formation steps.

Array processing (final image formation)

Combines multi-channel SAR outputs into final imagery products.

Can generate either:
a) 2-D SLC-style products via the “standard_phase” workflow, or
b) 3-D tomographic products via the “music” workflow

Collation and assembly

Merges products produced under multiple transmit configurations into a
unified image volume.

May optionally run layer tracking routines.

KEY SCRIPTS USED

The processing pipeline is orchestrated by a top-level MATLAB driver script:

Run_MultipleSteps_Greenland.m

This script calls the following step-specific scripts:

Run09_sar_rds_ndh.m
- Runs the SAR processing stage.
- Produces the precursor SAR products required for later array processing.

Run10_array_rds_ndh.m
- Runs array processing using SAR outputs from Run09.
- Produces either 2-D or 3-D products depending on configuration.

Run11_collate_Greenland.m
- Collates outputs from multiple transmit configurations into a unified
final image volume.
- Can optionally perform layer tracking.

Together, these scripts implement the pipeline from SAR precursor generation
to the final derived products that are distributed.

PARAMETER SPREADSHEETS (CRITICAL FOR REPRODUCIBILITY)

OPR processing is controlled using parameter spreadsheets. These spreadsheets
encode:

Which segments and frames to process

Where raw radar data are stored

Radar waveform definitions (sampling rates, time gates, chirp settings)

SAR processing parameters

Array processing parameters (2-D vs 3-D workflows, beamforming choices)

Output, posting, and data product settings

These spreadsheets are essential for reproducibility because they capture the
radar settings and processing decisions required to recreate the products.

Two example parameter spreadsheets are provided:

rds_param_2011_Greenland_P3.xlsx
rds_param_2012_Greenland_P3.xlsx

These can be used as templates for re-running the pipeline, adapting the
processing to other seasons, or documenting changes across campaigns.

FILES PROVIDED

The following files are included with this release:

(1) Run_MultipleSteps_Greenland.m
Type: MATLAB script
Purpose:
Top-level driver that orchestrates SAR processing, array processing,
and final collation.
Notes:
Requires the OPR toolbox environment and a configured startup script
(gRadar paths). Assumes access to raw data and support files.

(2) Run09_sar_rds_ndh.m
Type: MATLAB script
Purpose:
Executes SAR processing to generate precursor SAR products.
Notes:
Requires the parameter spreadsheet and access to raw data and support
files (e.g., records/frames).

(3) Run10_array_rds_ndh.m
Type: MATLAB script
Purpose:
Executes array processing (2-D or 3-D depending on configuration).
Notes:
Depends on SAR outputs from Run09.

(4) Run11_collate_Greenland.m
Type: MATLAB script
Purpose:
Collates outputs across multiple transmit configurations into a single
unified image volume and may run layer tracking.
Notes:
Depends on completed SAR and array processing outputs.

(5) rds_param_2011_Greenland_P3.xlsx
Type: Parameter spreadsheet
Purpose:
Defines radar settings, processing parameters, and run lists for the
2011 Greenland P3 season.
Notes:
Used as a reproducibility template and record of processing decisions.

(6) rds_param_2012_Greenland_P3.xlsx
Type: Parameter spreadsheet
Purpose:
Defines radar settings, processing parameters, and run lists for the
2012 Greenland P3 season.
Notes:
Used as an additional reproducibility template and comparison across
seasons.

PRACTICAL REQUIREMENTS TO REPRODUCE RESULTS

To reproduce the results distributed with this dataset, a user will need:

Access to the CReSIS/OPR environment

Raw radar data are not distributed publicly due to volume.

Supporting metadata and intermediate products are stored on CReSIS
servers and must be accessed there.

OPR toolbox installed and configured

A startup script must create and populate the global “gRadar” variable
and set the MATLAB path to include OPR toolbox commands.

gRadar must correctly point to raw data, support directories, and output
product locations.

Parameter spreadsheets

Required to define radar settings, data selections, and processing
parameters.

Provided example spreadsheets demonstrate typical configurations.

Adequate compute and storage

SAR and array processing are computationally intensive and I/O heavy.

These workflows are typically run on a cluster or within infrastructure
located close to the data storage.

SUGGESTED REPRODUCTION RECIPE (HIGH LEVEL)

This is a practical, minimal set of steps for reproducing the products:

Step 1: Request access
- Email opr@openpolarradar.org
 to request an account on the CReSIS servers.

Step 2: Configure OPR
- Install OPR and configure startup.m so gRadar points to:
* raw radar data directories
* metadata directories (GPS/INS)
* support directories (records, frames)
* output directories (CSARP products)

Step 3: Install parameter spreadsheets
- Place the provided parameter spreadsheets in the OPR parameter repository
and confirm that read_param_xls can load them correctly.

Step 4: Run the pipeline
- Run Run_MultipleSteps_Greenland.m, which will:
a) generate SAR precursor products (Run09)
b) generate array products (Run10; either 2-D or 3-D)
c) collate transmit configurations and optionally track layers (Run11)
